<b>Relationships among the Four Financial Statements</b>:  
1- Net earnings from the statement of earnings results in an increase in ending retained earnings on the statement of changes in equity    
2- Ending retained earnings from the statement of changes in equity is one of the three components of shareholders' equity on the statement of financial position.  
3- The change in cash on the statement of cash flows added to the case balance at the beginning of the year equals the balance of cash at the end of the year, which appears on the statement of financial position
