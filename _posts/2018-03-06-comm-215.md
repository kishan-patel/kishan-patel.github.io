### Ch 7 - Sampling Distribution:    
<strong>WHY?</strong> The reason we select a sample is to collect data to answer a research question about a population  
<strong>x̅:</strong> Point estimator of the population mean μ   
<strong>s:</strong> Point estimator of the population s.d. σ  
<strong>p̂̂:</strong> Point estimator of the popluation proportion p  
<strong>Population proportion:</strong> A part of a population with a particular attribute, expressed as a fraction, decimal, or percentage of the whole population  
<strong>Sample distribution of x̅:</strong> Probability distribution of all possible values of the sample mean  
<strong>Sampling distribution of p̂:</strong> Probability distribution of all possible values of the sample proportion p̂  
<strong>Probability distribution:</strong> Mathematical function that provides the probabilities of occurrence of different possible outcomes in an experiment  
<strong>Exepected value of x̅:</strong> E(x̅) = μ (when the expected value of the point estimator equals the population parameter, we say the point estimator is unbiased)  
<strong>Sample size of Sampling distribution:</strong>  
&nbsp;&nbsp; 1\ When the population has a normal distribution, the sampling distribution of x̅ is normally distributed for any sample size  
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2\ In most applications, the sampling distribution of x̅ can be approximated by a normal distribution whenever the sample size is 30 or more  
&nbsp;&nbsp; 3\ In some cases where the population is highly skewed or outliers are present, sample size of 50 may be needed  
&nbsp;&nbsp; 4\ The sampling distirbution of p̂ can be approximated by a normal distribution whenever the sample size is large enough to satisfy these two conditions np >= 5 and n(1-p) >= 5  
<strong>Central Limit Theorem:</strong> If you have a population with mean μ and standard deviation σ and take sufficiently large random samples from the population with replacement, then the distribution of the sample means will be approximately normally distributed  
<strong>Standard error (σx̅):</strong> Standard error of the mean  
<strong>Standard error (σp̂):</strong> Standard error of the proportion  

### Ch 8 - Confidence Intervals:  
<strong>Interval estimate:</strong> The purpose of an interval estimate is to provide information about how close the point estimate is to the value of the population parameter [(figure)]({{site.url}}/assets/pdf/comm-215/interval-estimate.png)  
<strong>Point estimate vs. Interval estimate:</strong> A point estimate is a single number that estimates the value of the population parameter, while an interval estimate includes a range of possible values which are likely to include the population parameter    
<strong>Confidence interval:</strong> Answers the question, how confident are you that the population mean will fall within this interval (are you 90% confident? 95%? or 99%?)  [(figure)]({{site.url}}/assets/pdf/comm-215/confidence-interval.png)

### Ch 9 - Hypothesis testing:  
<strong>Null hypothesis:</strong>  The null hypothesis is a statement about a population parameter. It is assumed to be true unless we have evidence to the contrary. The alternative hypothesis is an assertion that holds if the null hypothesis is false. It's not always the same as the assertion or verbal claim that led to the test. The null hypothesis must always contain the equal sign, if it does not, the claim is put in the alternative hypothesis and the opposite is put in the null hypothesis.
<strong>Alternative hypothesis:</strong> The alternative hypothesis is the 	research hypothesis, opposite of what is stated by the null hypothesis.  
<strong>Type 1 error:</strong> When you reject H0, but H0 is true (innocent person is wrongly convicted)  
<strong>Type 2 error:</strong> When you do not reject H0, but H0 is false (guilty person is acquitted)  
<strong>Decision rule:</strong> The decision rule specifies the conclusion to be reached for a given outcome of the test. It helps us decide whether to reject H0 or fail to reject H0 for a hypothesis test.
