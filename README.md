This is the repository for my personal website. It will mainly contain articles that are either programming related or fitness related. For programming articles, I intend to write about things that I learn (new technologies, best practices, etc) as well as cheat sheets for quick reference. As for the fitness related posts, my aim is to keep track of progress during a given workout plan. So, if for whatever reason you are interested, you can expect to find things like: what is my weight, how much am I lifting, what is the workout plan that I'm following, etc. etc.
