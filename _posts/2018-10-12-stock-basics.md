# Questions
1- What to look for when picking a stock (i.e. how do you know a stock is a good buy)?    
Not relevant at this moment since the goal is not to invest in individual stocks.

2- What are the different investment strategies for long-term growth?      
Buy-and-Hold and Crossover Trading are two (will most likely just stick to Buy-and-Hold as I don't to spend all my time monitoring stocks).

3- What are some ways to achieve a rate of return greater than 10%?  
The plant at the moment is to invest bond/stock ETFs for TFSA and stock ETFs for RPP, so in the former case, the goal is just to earn a return close to the market rate and on par with the market rate for the latter case.

4- What pieces of information should you monitor for companies you have holdings in?  
Not planning on investing in individual companies so question is not relevant at this point.  

5- What is the procedure to transfer to a Questrade TFSA account and buy stocks/etfs?  

<b>6- How do you read the performance of an ETF (i.e. does it include a fees, dividends)?</b>  
The performance includes fees, capital gains, as well as income from dividends [1].

<b>7- What is the rate of return if dividends are re-invested? Are dividends re-invested automatically?</b>  
Dividends are not re-invested automatically, but the performance (i.e. rate of return) takes into consideration dividend payments and assumes that they are re-invested [1].

<b>8- What is the difference between AGR and CAGR?</b>  
AGR stands for annual growth rate and CAGR stantds for compound annual growth rate. The CAGR represents the cumulative effects of a series of gains or losses on some amount over some period of time [5].  

AGR = sum of annual returns / # of years  
CAGR = (final amount / original amount)^(1 / # of years) - 1

E.g [6]:  
You start out with $100 and in the first year, your investment goes up by 100%, while in the second year, it goes down by 50%. How much do you have at the end of year 2 and what are the AGR and CAGR values?  

Amount at the end of 2 years = 100\*(1+100/100)*(1-50/100) = 100  
AGR = (100 - 50) / 2 = 50% (you're investment didn't go up by 50%, so this is not entirely accurate)  
CAGR = (100/100)^(1/2) - 1 = 0% (this is more accurate as your investment did not change)  

The bottome line is that if you are interested in knowing how much you're initial amount will be worth after x number of years, you need to know what the CAGR is and not the AGR.  

<b>9- What are the fees associated with holding US stocks in your TFSA?</b>  
There is a 15% witholding tax for any income earned from US stocks for non-US residents, however, there is not witholding tax that is applied if the US stocks in question are held in an RRSP account [2]. To qualify for this 15%, you'd need to fillout a W-8BEN form, otherwise, the witholding tax is 30% for non-US residents [3]. Questrade seems to take care of this and it doesn't appear as if clients need to fill out this form [4]. The taxes are witheld at source (i.e. you don't have to explicitly pay them).
  

<b>10- What is the procedure to rebalance on Questrade?</b>  
There are many rebalincing strategies:  
  (1) Calendar based - you rebalance anually or several times per year [7]  
  (2) Thresholds based - you rebalance when an asset it a certain number of percentage points above its treshold base [7]  
  (3) Cash flow based - this is more for people that make regular contributions and it involves buying more of the   underrepresented asset (or selling overrepresented assets in the case of withrawls) [7]  

<b>11- What is Norbert's Gambit?</b>  
It is a technique that allows you to eleminte currency exchange fess. If brokerages charge 1.5% for currency exchange, that equates to $15 for every $1,000 being exchanged, which can quickly add up. The idea involves buying shares that are listed on both Canadian and US exchanges [9]. You can use the Horizons U.S. Dollar Currency ETF to accomplish this [9].  

Below is the detailed procedure for converting $10,000 CAD to $USD:  
(1) See how many shares you can buy for $10,000 CAD [9]  
(2) Place an order for that many shares [9]  
(3) Call the brokerage to convert Canadian version of this ETF to the US version (the technique is called journaling?) [9]  
(4) Sell your US shares [9]  
Note: This technique will only work if you can hold US dollars into your account, which you can't in an RRSP [9].

<b>12- What is a margin account?</b>  
A margin account is a brokerage account where the broker lends the customer money to purchase stocks/bonds [10]. There is a periodic interest rate that is charged [10]. 

<b>13- How to use dividend yield to compute amount of dividends to be paid?</b>  
dividend yield = dividend per share / stock price per share  
divident per share = dividend yield * stock price per share  
total dividends = # of shares owned * dividend per share  

<b>14- How to automatically re-invest dividends?</b>  
You need to fill out a drip  (divident reinvestment plan) form [8].
