# Key Terms
Assests = Liabilities + Equities  
&nbsp;1/Assests - something that has value  
&nbsp;2/Liabilities - what the company owes  
&nbsp;3/Equities - what the owners get  

Market value of assets = share price * number of shares  (if you don't have debt, it says how much the assets/equity is worth)  

Gross Profit = Revenue - Sales  

Operating Profit = Gross Profit -  Fixed Costs (Marketing, Sales Commissions, etc.)  

Net Income (NI - what goes to the owners) = Operating Profit - Liabilities - Taxes - Some other stuff  

Enterprise Value (EV) =  Marketcap + Debt - Cash (cash is not associated with the enterprise) (This tries to capture the assets that are generating the operating profits for the enterprise)

TTM = Trailing Twelve Months  

Ratios:  
&nbsp;1/Return on Asses (ROA) = Operating Profit / Total Assests  
&nbsp;2/Return on Equity (ROE) = Net Income / Boook Value of Equity  
&nbsp;3/Earnings per Share (EPS) = Net Income / Total Number of Shares
&nbsp;4/Price to Equity (P/E) = Price of Share / Earnihgs per Share (EPS) (Loser P/E is desirable). It's not ideal for comparing two companies because it doesn't take into consideration the capital structure of the company. Two companies can have the save revenue but different P/E ratios due to debt and other liabilities. For this you need to consider the Enterprise Value.

# Stocks and Bonds
<strong>Buying share/stock</strong>: you're becoming partowner of the company  
<strong>Buying bonds</strong>: you become part lender to the company (e.g. if you buy a bond with a face value of $1,000, you're lending $1,000 to the company)  
<strong>Ways company generate money</strong>: debt (borrowing money) or equity (allowing people to become partial owners of the company)  
<strong>Security</strong>: something that can be bought or sold and has an economic value  (e.g. stock and bonds)  
<strong>Short sale</strong>: you short sales when you think the price of the stock is going to fall (e.g. you borrow a stock from your broker and sell it to the market for $100 (old market value), then the price of the stock falls to $50 (new market value), you pay back the 1 share that you own which is not at $50, so you just made $50). You pay interest on the share until you're borrowing the stock. You sell high and buy low instead of the traditional way where you buy low and sell high.  
<strong>Market Capitalization</strong>: represents how much the market values the equity portion of the a company. The value does not necessarily have to equal the value of the shareholder's equity in an income statement (i.e. the book value). If people are willing to pay $21.50 for a share and there are 10,000 outstanding shares, the market cap is $215,000.
